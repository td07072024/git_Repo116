Windsor Castle grounds cover 13 acres (5.3 hectares)[5] and combines the features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town.[6] The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992.[7] It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles.[8] As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having "a certain fictive quality", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating "a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity.[9] Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a "place amongst the greatest European palaces".
