The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, and the Edward III Tower in the southwest corner. The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward. Beneath the Round Tower sits a bronze statue of Charles II on horseback, which was inspired by Hubert Le Sueur's statue of Charles I in London; the Charles II statue at Windsor was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with a marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons.[16] The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, overlooking the River Thames, and the East Terrace, overlooking the Home Park; both terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century.[17] The East Terrace has a private formal rose garden, first laid out by George IV in the 1820s. The present garden was updated by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after being used for victory garden production during World War II, tended in part by Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. It was announced in 2020 that, for the first time in 40 years, the garden would be open to the public for a limited time.[18]

Traditionally, the Upper Ward was judged to be "to all intents and purposes a nineteenth century creation [which] stands as the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be", as a result of the extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV.[19] The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow Bath stone.[20] The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small pieces of flint in the mortar for galleting, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give a similar appearance to stonework from disparate periods. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century.[20] Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling.
