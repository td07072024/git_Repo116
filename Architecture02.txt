At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward, a bailey formed around the 'motte' (artificial hill) in the centre of the ward. The motte is 50 feet (15 m) high and made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch. The keep, called the Round Tower, on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building, extended upwards by 30 feet (9.1 m) in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville, to produce a more imposing height and silhouette.[11] The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned between 1991 and 1993 to provide additional space for the Royal Archives, an additional room being built in the space left by Wyatville's originally hollow extension.[11] The Round Tower is in reality far from cylindrical because of the shape and structure of the motte beneath it. The current height of the tower has been criticised as being disproportionate to its width; archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, for example, has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure.[12]

The western entrance to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace.[13] The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse.[13] Despite its name, this gatehouse dates from the 14th century; it is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings – including surviving medieval lion masks, which are traditional symbols of majesty – to form an impressive entrance to the Upper Ward.[14] Wyatville redesigned the exterior of the gatehouse, and later in the 19th century the interior was heavily converted for residential use.
